Write down the response code generated by the server as for the previous exercises

4b)

While your server is running, open Chrome developer tools and the network tab, 
and call this address: http://localhost:8080/i_dont_exist

Write down the response code generated by the server as for the previous exercises
HTTP/1.1 404 Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8 
Content-Language: en Content-Length: 1086 
Date: Wed, 28 Aug 2019 13:23:34 GMT

4c)
Your document, containing the Status Codes for all the exercises done so far, 
should now contain codes like 2xx, 3xx, 4xx and 5xx.
Explain (write down your answer so you won’t forget) the meaning of the 
first digit in the 3-digit Status Codes you have seen so far.
The list of status codes in the code:
200: OK status 
302: Found at the pointed url
304: not modified 
404: link not found 
500: internal server error (aka maybe error in the code) 
 
5) 
Have made a servlet called HeadGet. Can be found in the first link, 
its a simple for each loop while loops thourgh the values and 
print.out the header name and corresponding value. 

6)
Write down your observations

The form with the GET value in the method field:
1. Request URL: 
http://localhost:8080/HttpProt/workSix.html?FirstName=+gasg&LastName=+badas&hidden=12345678
2. Request Method: 
3. Status Code: 
304 Not modified 

The form with the POST value in the method field:
1. Request URL: 
http://localhost:8080/HttpProt/workSix.html
2. Request Method: 
POST
3. Status Code: 
200 OK
As seen in the with post the values form the inputs does not get 
return with the URL and neither on the search bar.

7) 
Write down your observations
The reason the browser dont forget me is with the help of the cookies, 
when running a new run servlet there Is created automatically a new cookies value for the session. 

here is the cookies for two diffrent sites when rerunning the servlet 
1. Cookie: 
JSESSIONID=460EDBCC31D4986CC4974C8273A61429
JSESSIONID=5DEFA1A724DDB2D2C66C30977D2C8002

8)
Write down your observations

Explain (on paper) how Cookies can be used to maintain “state” on the client between subsequent calls to a server, even when a browser has been closed down.

You can see that the browser rembers the cookie which is save on the cache. Because the cookies life span is set to be over a year so it wont forget it until at year has passed unsless the setMaxAge() changes to something

HTTP/1.1 200 Set-Cookie: username=boisa; 
Max-Age=31536000; 
Expires=Sat, 29-Aug-2020 17:44:31 GMT

1. Request URL: 
http://localhost:8080/demosHttp/CookieDemo?name=boisa
2. Request Method: 
GET
