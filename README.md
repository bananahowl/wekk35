# week 35 

## Assigment to 

In this repository is the work for week 35. <br/>
Each assignment day is set as a separate folder set with the day. <br> 
It should be said that since most of the work was to answer questions has they been made 
for the users understanding without elaborating more than needed, 
as there were not seen a need for it to understand the week material. <br>
following are:

- 27-08
  - The folder with the answers to the assignment [link]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/bananahowl/wekk35/tree/master/27-08))
  <br> The folder contains a text file called assignment doc 
  containing the answers for the assignment.
- 28-08
  - The folder with code made is split into two parts <br>
  as the assignment could would be best, so the first 
  link contains for 1-6
  and the second link contains for 7-8.
  <br> The answers to question that to this assignment can be found on the following [link called Answers for 2808.]([<https://github.com/bananahowl/wekk35/tree/master/28-08>](https://github.com/bananahowl/wekk35/tree/master/27-08))

    - Link to the [Second part](<https://github.com/bananahowl/wekk35/tree/master/28-08/demosHttp/src/main>)
- 29-08
  - To this part is a link to my domain site [pencilash.com](<https://pencilash.com/>) <br />
  after completing the setup to connect to my digital blue server. <br>
  The reason there is that there i not much to document to as the assignment is a setup guide.
